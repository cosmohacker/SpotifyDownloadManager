Hello everyone!
I decided to archive this repository due to lack of time and because of my intensity. This means I can no longer answer your questions/issues etc. But you can reach me whenever you want from my social links.

# ATTENTION
In Windows, the setup file can be detect as a virus, because the inno setup program is likely to be on the black list and I didn't make any certification for the setup, there is no virus. You can scan with external virus programs such as Kaspersky, Avast etc.

Here is same problems:
